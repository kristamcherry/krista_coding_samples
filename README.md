# Stata 
This is an excerpt of the Stata scripts that I'm currently working on. The main task is to create a list of "health shock" dates for each beneficiary, then create event study plots for various health shocks and outcomes. 

famhealth_01_shocks.do: cleans data to create an overall "shocks" date file for each beneficiary. 
famhealth_run.do: runs all Stata scripts. 

# R 
This is a script for a project using full-count historical census data to understand the impact of asylum closures in the U.S. It uses CensusTree links to link people between the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses. See https://www.censustree.org/.

# Python 
This is a project I did for AMATH 352 (applied linear algebra). The program uses matrix algebra to solve for voltages and currents in an electric circuit. 

I also put test1.txt and final.txt files in the folder which give possible starting conditions of the circuit. 

# Java 
This is a project I did for CSE 143 (Introduction to Computer Science (Data Structures). The program takes in a dictionary of words and a phrase, then returns all possible combinations of the letters in the phrase based on the dictionary. 

I included the specification for this assignment for more context. I included a dictionary of words, if you'd like to test the program yourself. 

# Matlab 
This is a script for an undergraduate assignment in AMATH383 (Continuous Mathematical Modeling). It numerically solves a Lorenz equation and plots the x value over time using two slightly different initial conditions. I also plot the 3-D Lorenz system (which has butterfly wings!) 

# C++ 
This is a script for an undergraduate assignment in MATH381 (Discrete Mathematically Modeling). It prints some conditions for a linear program which I copy/paste into a text file. I also attached the paper I wrote for the class so you can see what I use the statements for.
